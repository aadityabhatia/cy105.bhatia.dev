- Office: Thayer Hall 106
- Class Hours: A1, C1, A2, B2 (Fall 2024)

This course introduces the fundamentals of computing and cyberspace and blends theoretical knowledge with the practical application of computer hardware, software (programming), and cyberspace. Emphasis is placed on developing critical thinking skills and understanding the legal, ethical, and professional considerations as well as the challenges, opportunities, and attributes of the cyber domain.


## How to get better at CY105?

1. Complete [zyBook](https://learn.zybooks.com/zybook/WESTPOINTCY105Fall2024) required readings.
1. Attempt [zyBook](https://learn.zybooks.com/zybook/WESTPOINTCY105Fall2024) practice ICEs going back to the chapter that you do not fully grasp.
1. Seek assistance. Email me or book additional instruction.

Your success in this course is directly proportional to the number of programming problems that you successfully solve without assistance.


## Additional Instruction

- Use [Outlook Bookings](https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/eb7d00eba18d43f0a98c54dee80af31d@westpoint.edu/meetingtype/jltYy6M1Zk-gtINzpqM9Zw2) to schedule a time.
    - Please make the bookings in **Eastern Time**. If your computer or Outlook calendar shows a different time, pay extra attention.
    - Automatic booking is limited to 1100-1600. If you can see times outside that window, those are not in Eastern time.
- Come prepared with **specific questions**!

::: {.callout-note}
If Outlook booking times do not work, please email me. B1 and C2 hours (Fall 2024) are generally open. I can also meet outside of listed hours if needed. Reach out.

::: {.callout-warning}
Once you setup a meeting, it becomes your __assigned place of duty__. If you cannot make it, please notify me ahead of time. Not showing up to a scheduled meeting and failing to notify me ahead of time will typically result in a negative COR.
