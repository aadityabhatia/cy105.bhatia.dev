The hyper-text transfer protocol (“http” in the URLs) in conjunction with other protocols like DNS and TCP/IP help the browser communicate with a webserver. When a “client” requests the contents from a URL, the “server” sends back the HTML which is then displayed by the web browser, a program on our computer which requests the content and renders the HTML into a viewable format for the user.\nHTTP is exceptional insecure; it is highly recommended you always use HTTPS whenever you surf the web.

This is called cloud computing and is in contract to local processing and storage that would utilize your specific computers hardware resources. Cloud applications process and deliver data located on remote servers that are accessible via the Internet. Cloud applications have advantages over local drive applications, including:\nLittle to no software installation: Many applications in the cloud run on remote servers and process or stream data in real-time, thus alleviating users from having to download large software programs that require significant amounts of disk space.\n\nUp-to-date software: Applications running on the cloud are the most recent releases.\n\nLower cost: Some software applications are very expensive. For example, the Adobe Creative Suite 6 Master Collection, a drawing, photo, and video editing suite, once cost $2,599. Adobe Creative Cloud has moved to a subscription model that offers the same suite of applications for $50 a month, which is cheaper if only needed for a short time.\n\nEliminates the need for physical media: To listen to music or watch videos on the computer, users could only play physical disks (CDs, DVDs) or media files on the local drive. Current applications like Netflix and Spotify allow users to stream videos and music in the respective online libraries.\n\nAccess from many locations and devices: Cloud applications can be accessed by various user devices and from various locations.\nZyBook also discusses the concept of cloud storage, which is the storage of files on remotely-located servers, with those files being managed by apps via the web. Cloud storage has several advantages over storing files solely on a local computer drive:\n\nLocal storage is limited. Moving lesser-used files to cloud storage, such as large video files, can make room in local storage for more regularly-used files.\nFiles on cloud storage can serve as a backup. A backup is a copy of a file kept in case the local version is accidentally damaged or lost.\nFiles on cloud storage can be accessed by various user devices and from various locations."
