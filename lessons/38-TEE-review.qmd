## Academic Integrity

>
> A cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, or tolerate those who do.
>

- Instructors will see your zyBook history by keystroke!
- **Close all windows!**
    - `Alt-Tab` should not work!
- **No browser tabs** open except the exam interface.
    - Consider using a different browser!
- Work should be done on laptop screen only.
    - Big screen for reference card or part B prompt.
- Finish and submit part A _before_ starting part B; cannot go back.
- Reference card is the only authorized resource!
