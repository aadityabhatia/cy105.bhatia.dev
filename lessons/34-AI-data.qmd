## Lesson Objectives {data-background-image="/images/34/34.webp" data-background-opacity="0.1"}

- Define the term "artificial intelligence" (AI)
    - recall some of the key historical milestones in its development
- Differentiate betwen Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL)
- Differentiate Artificial Narrow Intelligence, Artificial General Intelligence, and Artificial Superintelligence.
- Identify potential applications and limitations of artificial intelligence in various fields and industries.


## Definitions

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=60%}
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)
    - solving problems in new, previously unseen scenarios
- Machine Learning (ML)
    - statistical and computational techniques
    - perform tasks without explicit programming!
- Deep learning (DL)
    - highly specialized subset of ML
    - uses artificial neural networks (NN)
    - attempt to simulate the human-learning process

## Machine Learning

- [Kaggle: Titanic Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)
    - given age, gender, class, family size, fare etc., predict who survived

## Artificial Narrow Intelligence

- One-trick pony!
- AI that is designed for a specific task
- Examples: Siri, Alexa, self-driving cars, ChatGPT
- How effective are they?
- [Can AI be creative?](https://openai.com/index/sora/)


## Artificial General Intelligence

- Ability of a machine to perform any intellectual task that a human can do
- Not yet achieved!!
    - How long until we get there?


## Artificial Superintelligence

- [What If We Created a Superintelligence?](https://www.youtube.com/embed/qq5Mn2N0bQI)
- [Artificial Super Intelligence Simply Explained](https://www.youtube.com/embed/c4c6P3Y790c)
- AI that surpasses human intelligence
- What could go wrong?
