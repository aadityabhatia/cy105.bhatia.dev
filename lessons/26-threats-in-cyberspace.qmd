## Lesson Objectives {data-background-image="/images/26/26.webp" data-background-opacity="0.1"}

- Identify and define the **three layers of cyberspace**
- Identify common **threat actors** and their _goals_ in cyberspace
- Identify common **vulnerabilities** in cyberspace
- Compare and contrast different **types of cyber attacks and scams**
    - e.g. malware, DoS, phishing, and social engineering


## Cyberspace

<br>

> A **global domain** within the information environment consisting of the interdependent **networks of information technology infrastructures and resident data**, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.

## Layers of Cyberspace {timing=180}

![](/images/26/cyberspace.jpeg){width="100%"}

::: {.notes}
- Distinct but interconnected!
- Physical: hardware, cables, servers, satellites, cell towers
- Logical: software applications, processes, data, information
- Cyber: user accounts and their connections
- How do these layers interact?

## Who owns the Cyberspace? {timing=120 .smaller}

<br>

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=33%}
### Blue Space

- DoD networks and systems
- Anything protected by the US
    - Mission partners
    - Critical infrastructure

## Risks {data-background-image="/images/26/26.webp" data-background-opacity="0.2"}

- Threats: **actors** with **intent** and **capability**
- Vulnerabilities: **weaknesses** in systems
- Risks: **likelihood** of a threat exploiting a vulnerability

### Threats + Vulnerabilities = Risks

::: {.notes}
- Examples?
- Why would they do it?
- What kind of resources might they have?
- motivated by glory, financial, political, ideological, or other reasons
