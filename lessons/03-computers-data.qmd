## Analog vs Digital Data {.smaller timing=60}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=30%}
- Analog
    - Continuous data
    - Smooth, unbroken line
    - Speed, temperature

## Scenario {timing=300}

### Power Outage
- You are working on a paper in the middle of the night. Suddenly, a powerful thunderstorm appears in the area and you lose power.
- Suppose you are working on a desktop computer. What happens to your paper? What data is lost?
- How does the above answer change if you were working on a laptop?
What are some advantages/disadvantages of autosave?

### Data Security
- Your friend is thinking about making some extra cash by selling their computer. What advice would you give them so their personal data does not get stolen?
- What concrete steps that you would recommend they take?
- Any components worth removing or keeping? How does your answer change if it is a phone, laptop or desktop?

# Data Representation {timing=0}

## Binary {timing=120}

- Light switch = on or off
- Only two values: 0 and 1
- Bit = binary digit
- Byte = 8 bits
- [How exactly does binary code work?](https://www.youtube.com/embed/wgbV6DLVezo)
- [Representing Numbers and Letters with Binary](https://www.youtube.com/embed/1GSjbWt0c9M)

::: {.notes}
- Bit = light switch, off or on
:::

## Hexadecimal {timing=120}

- Base 16 => 0-9, A-F
- 4 bits = 1 hex digit
- Easier for humans to read

::: {.notes}
- 16 objects, unique labels
- board example
:::

## Conversion: Decimal - Binary - Hexadecimal

## Quantifying Data Sizes

![](/images/03/data-sizes.png)

## ASCII

- American Standard Code for Information Interchange
- 7-bit encoding scheme
- 95 printable characters, 33 control characters
- Invented in 1963; last updated in 1986
