## Lesson Objectives {data-background-image="/images/18/18.webp" data-background-opacity="0.1"}

### Knowledge and Understanding = 25 points (quiz)

- Understand what robots are through the sense, think, and act paradigm
- List characteristics of tasks that are suited to being performed by robots instead of humans (dull, dirty, dangerous)
- Understand the military applications of robots

### Practical Skills = 75 points (activities)

- Construct a simple robot with a sensor, controller, and actuator
- Modify software to change hardware functionality
    - Put your Python skills to use!

## Robotics Day 1 {data-background-image="/images/18/18.webp" data-background-opacity="0.2"}

1. Grab a box and write your name on it; [begin inventory!](https://usma-eecs.github.io/CY105_Lab/Initial_Steps.html)
1. Install [Mu Editor](https://codewith.mu/) to interact with Bluefruit
1. Pull up the [Robotics Lab](https://usma-eecs.github.io/CY105_Lab/) on your second screen
    - Inventory all components
    - Warning: Separate screws (12x Gizmo, 2x for stand)! Stand screws have bigger thread and do not fit the Gizmo. Do not jam them in; they will damage the Gizmo. Combine stand screws with nuts early to separate them out.
1. Assemble the device - connectors flush with board; attach on correct side
1. Run the temperature sensor code
1. Continue working outside of class
    - Document all assistance outside classroom!
