## Given the following function {timing=120}

```python
def water_level(inches):
    if inches < 12:
        return "Low"
    elif inches < 24:
        return "Medium"
    else:
        return "High"
    return "Flooded!"
```

::: {.incremental}
- What is the return value of: `water_level(15)`
- What is the return value of: `water_level(30)`
- Can the function return more than one value?
- Can the function return "Flooded!"?

    return "Blastoff!"

def main():
    print(countdown(5))

main()
```

A) This program contains an example of indefinite iteration.
A) This program contains an example of definite iteration.
